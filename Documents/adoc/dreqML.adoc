[[executive-summary]]
[[anchor]]Executive Summary
---------------------------

The Data Request defines the diagnostics which are requested from
modelling centres participating in the sixth phase of the Climate Model
Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6).

The Data Request is presented as two XML files: a configuration file and
the content. Each file has an associated XSD schema. The XSD schema for
the content file is generated automatically from the configuration file.
For many users it will be more convenient to deal with the python
interface or web and spreadsheet versions of the request, which will be
described in a separate document. The transformation to an XML format
from the traditional spreadsheet format is designed to deal with a
number of issues associated with growing complexity and a need to
support automation driven by the scale of the request. In order to
preserve continuity, many of the records in the XML files will have a
direct relation to spreadsheet rows in the traditional format.

A separate document describes a simple python API for the data request.

The variables are now also listed in a spreadsheet of MIP tables:

http://proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/svn/exarch/CMIP6dreq/tags/latest/dreqPy/docs/CMIP6_MIP_tables.xlsx[proj.badc.rl.ac.uk/svn/exarch/CMIP6dreq/tags/latest/dreqPy/docs/CMIP6_MIP_tables.xlsx]

In release 01.beta.27 a supplement was added, containing records on
quality control and (under development) information about physical
relationships between variables. The supplement is presented as a
separate file in order to simplify the version management of the main
request document.

[[objectives]]
[[anchor-1]]Objectives
----------------------

The broad objectives of the data request are:

\(1) Define variables, together with technical information required for generation of output files;

\(2) Define collections of variables, from specified experiments, which are needed for or relevant to specific scientific objectives;

[[anchor-2]]Overview
---------------------

[[configuration-file]]
[[anchor-3]]Configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The XML Data Request is presented as a configuration file and a content file.

The configuration file contains three types of information:

. Layout information which is used to generate the content schema;
. Comments on the purpose and intent of attributes;
. Technical labels to facilitate automated navigation of the contents.

If users wish to exploit the XML files directly it is recommended that
they make use of the configuration file, as the information types (2)
and (3) are not embedded in the content file.

Each section of the document is defined by a “table” element with the
following attributes:

* label (e.g. 'var'): a name for a section of the content – will be used as the XML element name;
* title (e.g. 'MIP variable”): a longer, human readable string;
* id: an opaque name;
* itemLabelMode: specifies whether the “label” attribute of records in this section should permit use of '-';
* level: an integer, designed to assisted automated processing by giving an indication of the structure of the request;
* maxOccurs: maximum number of times the section is allowed;
* labUnique [Yes|No]: set to yes if label values for records are unique within each section.

Within each section there are definitions for attributes of items. Each
item attribute is defined using the following configuration attributes:

* label: this will be the attribute name;
* title: a longer string explaining usage;
* class: the class supports automation. e.g. attributes which refer to another record in the document will have the class set to
“internalLink”;
* type: the xsd content type (e.g. “XS:STRING”);
* techNote: to support automation. e.g. if class is “internalLink”, this
attribute should be set to the name of the intended section:
* required: indicates whether the attribute is required;footnote:
* usage: notes on the usage of the attribute.^1^
+

Since 01.beta.33 all properties (title, valid_max, valid_min, etc) in
all sections have been given a valid title to aid legibility of the
document: the titles of the attributes can be used, for instance, to
provide help notes in a web display of the data request.

In addition to the standard XSD content types “string”, “boolean”,
“integer”, “duration” and “float”, the following types are defined:

* st__integerList: a list of integers;^1^
* st__integerListMonInc: a monotonic increasing list of integers
(monotonicity is not checked by the XSD schema, but is verified by the
python API);^1^
* st__floatList: a list of integers;^1^
* st__stringList: a list of words;footnote:[New in 01.beta.19]
* st__attLabel_def: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to
“Z”, “0” to “9” and “-”;
* st__attLabel_und: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to
“Z”, “0” to “9” and “_”;
* st__attLabel_an: a string composed of characters “a” to “z”, “A” to
“Z”, “0” to “9”;
* st__uid: a-zA-Z0-9:_.+-
* st__fortranType : string defining a variable type: “real”, “integer”,
“character” or “double”;
* st__configurationType : a string defining a model configuration option
: “size”, “category”, “ioOption”, “capability”.

The following table summarises the specifications of the core
attributes:

[width="80%",cols="<2s,^2,^10,8e",options="header",role="vocab"]
|=======================================================================
|Label |Title |Description |Usage

|label |Record Label |A single word, with restricted character set |A
short mnemonic word which is potentially meaningful but also concise and
suitable for use in a programming environment

|uid |Record Identifier |Unique identifier |Must be unique in the data
request. For well known concepts this may be related to the label, but
for items such as simple links between concepts an a random string will
be used.

|title |Record Title |A few words describing the object |A short phrase,
suitable for use as a section heading

|description |Record Description |An extended description of the
object/concept. |

|useClass |Record Class |The class: value should be from a defined
vocabulary. All records in the schema definition section must have class
set to ''__core__''. |The useClass declared for an attribute can affect
its interpretation in the Python package. For example, attributes
labelled as “useClass=internalLink” should refer to another data request
record.

|type |Record Type |The type specifies the XSD value type constraint,
e.g. xs:string. |

|techNote |Technical Note |Additional technical information which can be
used to specify additional properties. |

|superclass |Superclass |States what class the property is derived from
|

|id |Alternative identifier |Alternative identifier |For sections, the
id provides a short alias for the section label.

|itemLabelMode |Item Label Mode |Item Label Mode |

|level |Level |Level |Redundant

|maxOccurs |Maximum number of permissible occurrences of this section
|Maximum number of permissible occurrences of this section |Used in
defining sections. In the CMIP6 Data Request each section only occurs
once.

|labUnique |Set true if label of each record is unique within section
|Set true if label of each record is unique within section |Used in
defining sections.

|usage |Usage notes |Notes on the usage of the predicate/concept defined
by this node |
|=======================================================================

The above attributes provide the framework for detailed description of
data request attributes and diagnostics.

[[content-file-dreq.xml]]
[[anchor-4]]Content file (dreq.xml)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The content file contains three elements at the top level: “prologue”,
“main” and “annex”footnote:[New in 01.beta.16]. The “prologue” contains
Dublin Core metadata describing the document and a PAV version attribute
holding the document versionfootnote:[New in 01.beta.29
(http://purl.org/pav/2.3[purl.org/pav/2.3])]. The “main” element has the
sections specified in the configuration file, and within each section a
list of records (“item” elements). Each item element has attributes as
specified in the configuration file, a different set of attributes for
each section. There are no child elements or text content, all the
information is in the defined attributes. Every item, across all
sections, will have at least these 3 common attributes which are
intended to give basic information about the item, thus enabling
standardisation in error tracking:

* uid: an identifier which is unique within the document;
* label: a short name, using only the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '-'
(in some sections the '-' is disallowed);
* title: a longer name.

The “annex” element also contains a list of sections with the same
structure as in the “main” element. The “annex” has been introduced to
allow some flexibility in the version management.

[[sections]]
[[anchor-5]]Sections
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are 35 sections in the current document, 6 of which contain
information about variables, output format and their priorities. An
index to the request sections is available here:
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index.html .

The sections, with section numbers, are listed below:

[[model-intercomparison-project-mip]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/mip.html[1.1 Model Intercomparison Project \[mip\]]

[[mip-variable-var]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/var.html[1.2 MIP Variable \[var\]]

Each MIP variable record defines a MIP variable name, associated with a
CF Standard Name.

[[cmor-variable-cmorvar]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/CMORvar.html[1.3 CMOR Variable \[CMORvar\]]

Each Output variable record corresponds to a MIP table variable
specification. In a change from the August draft, this record does not
contain the “priority” attribute: the priority is now set in the
“Request Variable” record. The other change is that a collection of
attributes specifying dimensions have been moved into the “structure”
record, and each “CMOR Variable” record links to one structure record.
This will fa­cilitate provision of clear and consistent definitions of
output formats. A “processing” attribute provides additional guidance on
processing in some cases.

[[request-variable-carrying-priority-and-link-to-group-requestvar]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/requestVar.html[1.4 Request
variable (carrying priority and link to group) \[requestVar\]]


The request variable is now a short record which combines a CMOR
variable with a priority and assigns it to a request group. The request
variable records define the contents of each request group.

[[experiments-experiment]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/experiment.html[1.5 Experiments \[experiment\]]

The experiment record contains the key information from the “Experiment”
sheet of the request template, including the tier of the experiment, the
duration and start/end dates. The default ensemble size is specifed by
“ensz”; some MIPs may request data from more than the default number of
ensemble members.

[[scientific-objectives-objective]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/objective.html[1.6 Scientific objectives \[objective\]]

The objectives defined by each MIP can be used to select data requirements.

[[specification-of-dimensions-grids]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/grids.html[1.7 Specification of dimensions \[grids\]]

A section for the CMOR dimensions specifies the structure of the axes of
the requested diagnostics.

[[cf-standard-names-standardname]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/standardname.html[1.8 CF
St]http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/standardname.html[andard Names \[standardname\]]

The reference list of CF standard names is provided at
cfconventions.org, but the definitions of terms used in the data request
are copied into this section so that the detailed definitions are easily
accessible to data request users.

[[experiment-group-exptgroup]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/exptgroup.html[1.9 Experiment Group \[exptgroup\]]

The experiment group defines a collection of experiments within a MIP
which might be part of a collective data request.

[[spatial-dimensions-spatialshape]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/spatialShape.html[2.1
Spatial dimensions \[spatialShape\]]

The spatial shape record contains the spatial dimensions of the field,
and also, for convenience, an integer specifying the number of levels if
that number is specified. A boolean level flag is set to “true” if the
number of vertical levels is specified.

[[temporal-dimension-temporalshape]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/temporalShape.html[2.2
Temporal dimension \[temporalShape\]]

The temporal shape record contains the temporal dimensions.

[[dimensions-and-related-information-structure]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/structure.html[2.3
Dimensions and related information \[structure\]]

The structure record combines specification of dimensions, cell_measures
and cell_methods attributes. Spatial and temporal dimensions are
specified through links to “spatialshape” and “temporalshape” records.

[[mip-tables-miptable]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/miptable.html[2.4 MIP tables
\[miptable\]]

[[request-variable-group-a-collection-of-request-variables-requestvargroup]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/requestVarGroup.html[3.1
Request variable group: a collection of request variables
\[requestVarGroup\]]

The request variable groups collect variables.

[[request-item-specifying-the-number-of-years-for-an-experiment-requestitem]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/requestItem.html[3.2 Request
Item: specifying the number of years for an experiment \[requestItem\]]

The request item links a collection of variables with a specific
experiment or group of experiments, and a temporal range for output. The
“esid” attribute links to an experiment, and experiment group or a MIP.
In the latter case, the request applies to all experiments defined by
that MIP. The Request Item includes a “Tier Reset” attribute
(“treset”)footnote:[New in 01.beta.17] which can override the Tier
assigned to the experiments identified by “esid”. Has an optional link
to a time slice^3^.

There is an “nenmax” attribute which specifies the number of ensemble
members that the request applies to. A value of -1 implies that data is
wanted from all ensemble members. If “nenmax” is greater than “ensz” it
implies that the requesting MIP wants more simulations than the default
ensemeble size.

[[request-link-linking-a-set-of-variables-and-a-set-of-experiments-requestlink]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/requestLink.html[3.3 Request
link: linking a set of variables and a set of experiments \[requestLink\]]

The request link records specify some additional information about
variable groups, concerning shared output requirements and objectives.

Each objective link record joins one objective to one request link. Some
requests are linked to multiple objectives and most objectives are
linked to multiple requests.

[[remarks-about-other-items-remarks]]
http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/remarks.html[3.08 Remarks
about other items \[remarks\]]

The remarks section contains additional comments about other records. It
can be used to add detail without adding to the complexity of the other
sections.

http://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index/varChoice.html[3.10
Indicates variables for which a there is a range of potential CMOR
Varibles $$[varChoice]$$]

There are several instances where variables defined in the tables are
mutually exclusive options of which only one should be requested. The
varChoice section is designed to hold this information, but is not yet
complete. Examples are between ocean cell volume on a fixed grid for
some models and monthly means for others, or between 6 hourly pressure
level data on 8 levels vs. 4 levels for different objectives in the
HighResMIP request.

CMIP5 CMOR tables. In this section there are also attributes
valid_max_status etc which indicate the level of confidence in the
suggested limits:

* [[anchor-6]]**robust**: A well characterised limit based on a rigorous
constraint (e.g. and area fraction must be between 0 and 1) or on a
large ensemble of consistent model results.
* **suggested**: A limit which may not be reliable, but which is based
on a range of models or plausible arguments.
* **tentative**: Very limited information – e.g. only one or two models
in CMIP5 provided the parameter.

[[discussion]]
[[anchor-7]]Discussion
----------------------

The layout of the variable definitions has been rationalised into 5
sections: the “MIP variables” defining the physical parameters,
“structure”, “spatialShape” and “temporalShape” defining output
configuration and a “CMOR Variable” bringing all these together. The
Request Variable table then links CMOR variables together in Request
Groups. The request groups give the MIP coordinators the ability to pick
and choose precisely the variables needed for each analysis, avoiding
requests for unnecessary data. This will result in request groups which
contain overlapping data requirements. The use of links back to CMOR
variables make it possible to unambiguously determine the union of any
set of request groups.

The sections on structure and shape separate out different aspects of
the CMOR variable specification and make it possible to ensure that
terms are used consistently. The contents if these sections in this
draft have been created by scanning the CMOR tables, and there is some
duplication (e.g. the cell_measures variable attribute is set for some
variables and omitted for others, creating two sets of structure records
which are identical except for this distinction. In CMIP6 the
cell_measures attribute will always be set).

The link between the request items and the experiment definitions is not
fully implemented in this version, but the links through to the
variables are. This means it is possible to gain an estimate of the data
volumes for each MIP and for combinations of MIPs, but not yet to select
specific tiers in a clean way (see dreqPy.pdf for more details). The
data volumes given by the current version should be treated with
caution. The contents may not fully reflect the intentions of the MIP
coordinators, and there may be adjustments to variable priorities.
